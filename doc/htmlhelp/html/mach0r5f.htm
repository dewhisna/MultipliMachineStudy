<P>Several other helps have been included that can play a major role in the overall design of the paper machine.</P>

<P>1) <B>FLOW</B></P>

<P>A) <B>PIPE SIZE</B>. This calculator will allow you to enter either of the two(2) variables and calculate the third.  Example: if you know the gallons per minute and velocity in feet per second you want, enter them and then click the pipe size "CALC" button to get the correct pipe ID in inches.</P>

<P>B) <B>AREA SIZE</B>. This works just like the above, except we are playing to a known or unknown cross sectional area. This is very helpful in the design of reducers, headboxes, etc.</P>

<P>2) <B>HEADBOX DILUTION</B>. Here we are starting with a known consistency. We can then find how much water is required to dilute to another consistency.</P>

<P>3) <B>PRODUCTION</B>. (Tons Per Day or Kilograms Per Day) This is one of the most important parts of this program and allows you to calculate the production yield for a given machine speed, grade, face width, and machine efficiency (or up-time percentage).  When launched within the SHEET FORMATION calculator, you can click "APPLY" and transfer your results back to the main SHEET FORMATION window and optionally recalculate the FORMATION CONSTANT.</P>
