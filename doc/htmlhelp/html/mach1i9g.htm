<P>The Main Window in the Machine Study program is actually a full-screen text editor window. When saving data from a given calculator window, the "printout" information is first placed on this editor window (either clearing or appending present editor data).  Then this editor window can be further annotated and/or sent directly to the printer.</P>

<P>The user can also select the "SAVE" option from the "FILE" menu selection, allowing the user to save and store information about a particular paper machine or setup configuration.</P>

<P>Note that at any later time, the user can use the "OPEN" option from the "FILE" menu selection to retrieve the saved file (or any other text file for that matter).  This allows new information to be appended to an existing file or for the saved information to be printed (by using the "PRINT" option from the "FILE" menu selection).</P>

<P>Since this data is saved as a standard ASCII TEXT FILE, it can be copied or exported to almost any other document or program.</P>

<P>The printer setup, selection, and configuration can be done from the "PRINT" option on the "FILE" menu.  Or, for a more interactive print setup experience, select "PRINT PREVIEW" on the "FILE" menu to see the configuration results before sending to the printer.</P>

<P>The specific printers and/or print-file-output types listed will depend on the printers configured in your Operating System.  Refer to your Operating System documentation for printer installation and configuration.</P>
