<P>All paper machine's production is governed by the rate of DRAINAGE hereafter referred to as "RATE OF FORMATION".  The data and knowledge base for this software is drawn from almost twenty years (as of this writing in 1994) of cylinder machine design and fabrication.  Along with this, of course, goes almost the same amount of time and intense scrutiny of both<B> <I>MULTIPLI's</I></B> and other manufactures' types of like equipment.  The intent is to assist in furthering this art form to the <B>pinnacle of potential </B>as related to the<B> RATE OF FORMATION</B>.  As we learned more and more about cylinder board manufacturing, we also learned more about the people attempting to manufacture under this process.  Due to the varied backgrounds, learning experiences, and types of equipment used, no common nomenclature nor general understanding exist unilaterally.  We feel that if some<B> common comparison system </B>were in place, a much better overall appreciation of this manufacturing process could be achieved.  Example: the best of these numbers are produced with a 42" dia. dry vat running at a 0.6% consistency with a 320 C.S.F. (Canadian Standard Freeness).  This program contains the most basic of formulas used in such an analysis system.  We have attempted to present this information in a simple and easy to use format, with as predictable results as possible.  We are always eager for any input that would either simplify, expand on, or improve this software and its application.</P>
