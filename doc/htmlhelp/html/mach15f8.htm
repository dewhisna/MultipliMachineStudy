<P>The cylinder board industry basically stands on two feet, FORMATION QUANTITY and FORMATION QUALITY. The quantity and quality of product directs every major decision making process, driving this industry in one form or another.  The paper making process is like a large circle with QUALITY at one end of the diagonal and QUANTITY at the other.  Literally hundreds of variables and constants lie on both halves of this circle.  A single change of any point on the circle affects the total paper making either directly or indirectly in varying degrees.  Therefore, when using this program, one should fill in as much information as possible in all of the related windows before drawing conclusions.</P>

<P>Every variable within the program is changeable.  This is to say, all numbers entered will produce a numerical result <B><I>regardless of reality</I></B>. <U>Example</U>: The logic base used is centered around the formula:</P>

<P>SHORT TONS PER DAY / FACE WIDTH in inches / NUMBER OF CYLINDERS</P>

<P></P>

<P>Unlike the comparison of TONS PER INCH OF TRIM, this approach yields a technique by which present or potential maximum production of any grade on any machine may be analyzed, since all calculations are based on <B>tons / inch of forming area</B>.</P>

<P>To help keep the numbers within <B><I>reality</I></B>, we have installed a set of "benchmarks".  These numbers supplied by <B><I>MULTIPLI </I></B>are in two(2) grades, FOLDING BOX and TUBE BOARD.  At present, three(3) cylinder sizes may be solicited, 36" DIA. , 42" DIA. ,  AND 48" DIA.  The data is from only quality board machines, at present standards, from Japan, U.S. of A., Canada, and some of the better of South America.  Therefore, the <B><I>MULTIPLI </I></B>CONSTANT is about Quality and not maximum predicable tons for any given machine.</P>
