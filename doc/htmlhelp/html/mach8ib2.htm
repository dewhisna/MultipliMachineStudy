<P>This version of this application was written using Qt 5.11.1 (<U>https://www.qt.io/</U>).  As such, it's very portable and capable of running on most any operating system, such as Windows, Linux, and Mac.  However, due to the burdens required to provide binary installers ready to run on all of those operating systems, this application is only being provided in binary form for Microsoft Windows, which will run on any Intel-based Windows 7 and higher system, either 32-bit or 64-bit.</P>

<P>To run this application on other operating systems, or to extend or modify the Windows version, it will be necessary for you to compile it yourself from the source code provided on GitHub at <U>https://github.com/dewhisna/MultipliMachineStudy</U>.  To compile it from source, you will, of course, need to download the correct Qt package for your computer from <U>https://www.qt.io/</U>.  And you will need to install, and possibly purchase, the proper C++ compiler and development tools for your system.</P>

<P>To install the application on Windows, simply download the latest installer from <U>https://github.com/dewhisna/MultipliMachineStudy/releases</U> or obtain it from Multipli Machinery.  Copy the installer package to a convenient location on your computer, such as your desktop.  Right-click the installer package and select "Run as Admin" and follow the directions.</P>
