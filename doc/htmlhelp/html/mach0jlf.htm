<P>1) <B>TONS / DAY</B>.(@ 2,000 lbs./ton in U.S., or  kilograms/day in metric) Please note that with this program, one can view and use this number either from the wet end or as finished goods. This is particularly helpful in sizing of pulpers, piping, and the like.</P>

<P>2) <B>SHEET TRIM</B>. (in inches or millimeters) Like tons/day, sheet trim can be the formed tons at the wet end for beater room and wet end design, or be the trimmed tons at the dry end.</P>

<P>3) <B>CONSISTENCY</B>.  This is the delivered consistency to the vat and not the actual forming consistency within the vat. If there is a top and/or back liner, these should be calculated separately. (also see HEAD BOX DILUTION)</P>

<P>4)<B> BASIS WEIGHT</B>. (in lbs/1000 square feet or grams/meter squared)</P>

<P>5) <B>MACHINE SPEED</B>. (in feet/minute or meters/minute)</P>

<P>6) <B>NUMBER OF VATS</B>. This is calculated from the <B><I>MULTIPLI </I></B>constants or may be entered for an existing or desired machine. If the <B><I>MULTIPLI </I></B>constants are used, a single stock system is assumed.</P>

<P>7) <B>GALLONS PER MINUTE</B>. (or liters/minute) Two(2) numbers are presented here, the total machine consumption and the average per vat.  If the top or back liners are different, this should be allowed for.</P>

<P>8) <B>MACHINE EFFICIENCY</B>. If left at 100%, 24 hour days at 365 days per year is assumed.  This adjustment is used to change tons per day (or kilograms per day) to match a year's production.</P>
